## About the email build tool ##
This site is intended to be used as a tool to allow users to generate HTML to be copied and pasted into their email marketing platform. Different email sections need first to be created manually by a developer. Each "Collection" can contain a different set of template files. Once set up, an author can choose an email layout (a collection), and add different sections to it, customizing each section by editing frontmatter.
